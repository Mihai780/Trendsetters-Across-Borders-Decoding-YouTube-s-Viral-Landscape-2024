# Trendsetters-Across-Borders-Decoding-YouTube-s-Viral-Landscape-2024
This repository analyzes cultural and social patterns in trending YouTube videos through emoji usage, title length vs. HDI, and category popularity across countries.

# Data
1. This study is based on daily snapshots of [YouTube trending videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/trending-youtube-videos-113-countries) from 113 countries for the year 2024. Key features include collection date, country, video title, view count, publication date, and video category. 
2. The dataset was enriched with [Human Development Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) (HDI) data (from 2022), selected because HDI tends to remain relatively stable over a two-year period.
( Live streams and “shorts” were excluded to maintain consistency and limit API anomalies. During preprocessing, missing values and outliers were addressed, global duplicate videos (appearing in multiple countries) were removed, and only one trending video per channel was retained. Countries with fewer than 500 observations were also filtered out.)
